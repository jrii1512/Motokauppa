# Motokauppa 
Has been developed with html5, css, javascript, php and mysql. It has currently shop / kauppa section and then admin section what can be used to upload new products to mysql db. When user opens up url (localhost location) then shop page fetch data from the db and show those according css rules. 

It doesn't have payment section and currently it's also missing signing / registering at this moment. 

Software done on my personal exercise on my time in the web-development course.
